# AES Encryption Project

## Compile and Run

To compile and run the code, install rust and cargo, then run `cargo run` in the root directory
of the project. (The root directory is the one with the `Cargo.toml` file in it.)

## Resources

I only used the resources listed in the project in order to implement the AES encryption algorithm.

## Appendix C

This correctly encrypts and decrypts the examples provided in Appendix C. The steps in between don't
match the output of Appendix C, and I wasn't able to figure out why, but the final output is correct.
